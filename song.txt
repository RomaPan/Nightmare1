Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies, just hold me closely
Don't patronise, don't patronise me

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
And here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
